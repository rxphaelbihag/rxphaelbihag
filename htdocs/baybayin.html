			<h1>Baybayin</h1>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p id="p1">
			<b>Baybayin</b>, also known incorrectly as <u>Alibata</u>, is an ancient writing system that was used in the islands of the Philippines. It's an alpha-syllabary from the <b>Brahmic script</b> family. During the 16th and 17th centuries, it was commonly used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines before being replaced by the Latin alphabet. Baybayin comes from the word <b>“<i>baybay</i>”</b>, which literally means “spell”.

					<td id="first">
					<p>Southeast Asia was historically influenced by Ancient India, and various Indianized principalities and empires flourished in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Vietnam for centuries. The word "Indianization" refers to the spread of Indian influence in these areas. It was identified by a French archaeologist, George Coedes, as the spread of an organized culture based on Indian royal origins, Hinduism and Buddhism, and the Sanskrit language. The propagation of Hinduism and Buddhism in Southeast Asia is evidence of Indianization.The Malay, Thai, Filipino, and Indonesian honorifics were all inspired by Indian honorifics. Raja, Rani, Maharlika, Datu, and other terms from Indian community were brought to the Philippines by the Malays and the Srivijaya empire.
					</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td id="first">
					<p>According to inscriptions, the first Indian colonists in Champa and the Malay archipelago came from the Pallava dynasty and brought their Pallava script with them. The Pallava script is used in the oldest inscriptions in Java. In the early stages of the adoption of Indian scripts, inscriptions in Indian languages were made locally. The scripts were then used to write the local Southeast Asian languages in the second level. Local variations of the scripts were developed in the third level. The scripts had diverged and fragmented into regional scripts by the eighth century.

			<h3>South Sulawesi Scripts</h3>
			<p id="desc">
			Accepting the view that the scripts of the Malay archipelago originate in India, David Diringer claims that the South Sulawesi scripts are descended from the Kawi script, most likely from the Sumatran Batak script. According to Diringer, the Philippine scripts may have arrived in the Philippines through Sulawesi's Buginese characters. The Philippine scripts may have arrived in the Philippines via Sulawesi's Buginese characters, according to Diringer. Baybayin's immediate ancestor, according to Scott, was most likely a South Sulawesi language, most likely Old Makassar or a near ancestor. This is due to Baybayin's lack of final consonants and vowel canceller markers. </p>
			<center><img id="sulawesi" src="../images/Sulawesi script.gif" alt="Sulawesi script"></img></center>
			<p id="desc">The syllable-final consonants in South Sulawesi languages are few, and they are not represented in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The absence of final consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore most likely due to its immediate ancestor being a South Sulawesi script.Sulawesi is located immediately south of the Philippines, and evidence of trade routes exists between the two countries. Since the Bugis-Makassar script was produced in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE, Baybayin must have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE.</p>

			<h3>Kawi Script</h3>
			
			<p id="desc">
			The Pallava script gave rise to the Kawi script, which originated in Java. It was widely used in Maritime Southeast Asia. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, discovered in the Philippines, is the earliest known written text. It is a legal document with the inscribed date of Saka era 822, corresponding to April 21, 900 AD. It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of Old Malay containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between Old Javanese and Old Tagalog. 
			</p>

			<p id="desc">
			The Butuan Ivory Seal, discovered in the 1970s and dated between the 9th and 12th centuries, is the second example of Kawi script. It's an ivory seal that was discovered in an archaeological site in Butuan. The seal has been designated as a National Cultural Treasure by the  government. The word "Butwan" is written in stylized Kawi on the seal. The ivory seal is now on display at the Philippine National Museum. As a result, one theory proposes that Baybayin descended from Kawi, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing in the Philippines.

			<h3>Eastern Cham script</h3>
			
			<p id="desc">
			Baybayin may have been brought to the Philippines through maritime links with the Champa Kingdom. The Baybayin characters "ga," "nga," "pa," "ma," "ya," and "sa" have characteristics that can best be described by connecting them to the Cham script rather than other Indic abugidas, according to Geoff Wade. Baybayin seems to have more in common with Southeast Asian scripts than with Kawi. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, according to Wade, is insufficient evidence of a Kawi root for Baybayin since it contains final consonants, which Baybayin lacks.	</p>

			<h3>In the Philippines</h3>
			<p id="desc">
			Baybayin survived and developed into the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro, and was used to establish the modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palaw'an tribe in the 19th and 20th centuries.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="desc">
			Baybayin was clearly used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, Pangasinan, Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, according to the available evidence, but there is no proof that it reached Mindanao. The Luzon and Palawan varieties seem to have begun to evolve in different ways in the 1500s, long before the Spaniards invaded what is now known as the Philippines. This places Luzon and Palawan as the most ancient areas where Baybayin was and is still used. It's also worth noting that by the early 1600s, the Pampanga script had already developed unique shapes for four letters that were distinct from those used elsewhere. In the late 1500s and 1600s, there were three distinct varieties of Baybayin, but they couldn't be identified as three separate scripts any more than the various types of Latin script across medieval and modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems could be described as three different scripts.

			<p id="desc">
			Baybayin is also known as Badlit, Kudlit-kabadlit for Visayans, Kurditan, Kur-itan for Ilocanos, and Basahan for Bicolanos in modern times.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Characteristics</h2>
			<p id="p2">
			Baybayin is an Abugida (alphasyllabary) language, which means it uses consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, or titk, is a consonant that ends in the vowel "A" in its simplest form. A mark called a kudlit is put above (to produce a "E" or "I" sound) or below the character to produce consonants ending with other vowel sounds (to produce an "O" or "U" sound). Three characters are used to write words that start with a vowel: one for A, one for E/I, and one for O/U.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Virama</h3>
			
			<p id="desc">
			Originally, baybayin omits a word's final character. When written in baybayin, the number of syllables equals the number of characters. As a result, Spanish priests struggled to translate books into the vernaculars. The absence of the final character/consonant with no vowel causes readers to be perplexed as to which word the author intended.For example, ‘bundok’ would be spelled as bu-du. As a result, in 1620, Fransisco Lopez invented his own kudlit, known as a sabat or krus (the krus "+" symbol refers to Christianity). This cross-shaped kudlit has the same feature as the virama in India's Devanagari script.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Punctuation</h3>
			
			<p id="desc">
			Baybayin used only one punctuation mark, called Bantasán, at first. Baybayin now uses two punctuation marks: the Philippine single punctuation (|), which serves as a comma or verse splitter in poetry, and the double punctuation (||), which serves as a period or paragraph end. These punctuation marks are similar to single and double danda signs in other Indic Abugidas, and they can be displayed vertically or slanted like Indic dandas. The symbols are consistent across Philippines scripts and were encoded in the Hanunóo script block by Unicode. Word distinction was not used in the past since words were written in a continuous flow.
