# Projects

## 🐍 Python
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🌾 [Agriculture Crop Yield Analysis](https://github.com/rxphaelbihag/Python-Data-Analysis-Case-Studies/blob/main/Agriculture%20Crop%20Yield%20Analysis.ipynb) | Data Wrangling & EDA | In this analysis, we aim to answer a few research questions regarding agricultural yields to demonstrate how data science is a vital tool for this generation's scientific endeavors. | pandas, scipy, matplotlib/seaborn |
| 🍃 [Air Quality Analysis Philippines](https://github.com/rxphaelbihag/Python-Data-Analysis-Case-Studies/blob/main/Air%20Quality%20Philippines.ipynb) | Data Wrangling & EDA | This notebook uses real and validated climate data from Project CCHAIN to answer a few reseach research questions primarily about the air quality of the Philippines. This is to demonstrate how data science is key in understanding the conditions of the climate to aid initiatives like climate action. | pandas, scipy, matplotlib/seaborn, statsmodels |

| 🥗 [Week #1: Danny's Diner](https://github.com/rxphaelbihag/SQL-Data-With-Danny/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%231%20Danny's%20Diner) | Data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation | This is the first week of Danny's 8 Week SQL Challenge. This week shows solutions to the case study questions where Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and also which menu items are their favourite. |
| 🍕 [Week #2: Pizza Runner](https://github.com/rxphaelbihag/SQL-Data-With-Danny/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%232%20Pizza%20Runner) | Data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation | This is an ongoing project. |

| 📦 [Multiple Period Production-Inventory Model](https://github.com/rxphaelbihag/Linear-Programming/blob/main/Production_Inventory_Optimization.ipynb) | Supply Chain Optimization | The notebook provides a comprehensive solution to a multiple period production-inventory optimization problem taken from Operations Research: An Introduction (10th ed.) by Taha, H. (2017). This is aimed at minimizing total costs over a six-month horizon. By balancing fluctuating monthly production costs against a fixed $8 monthly inventory holding cost per unit, the model determines an optimal schedule that meets specific delivery contracts for windows. This implements the solution using both the PuLP and SciPy Python libraries. |

| [Automatic Photo Overlay](https://github.com/rxphaelbihag/Photo-Dump-Overlay) | This script is an automated batch image processor designed to standardize photo collections by applying consistent scaling, cropping, and framing. This was written to facilitate the editing of photo documentation of a school organization after every event. Using the Pillow library and HEIF support, it recursively scans a source directory to find images, automatically corrects their orientation via EXIF metadata, and then resizes or center-crops them to fit a specific target dimension. The core functionality involves intelligently handling different aspect ratios (Portrait vs. Landscape) to ensure the subject is centered before pasting a standardized graphical overlay—such as a brand frame or watermark—on top of each file. | Python; Pillow, Pillow_HEIF |
| [CipherNotes](https://github.com/rxphaelbihag/AMAT152-Final-Project/tree/main) | This C program is a multifunctional cryptography and notes management system that allows users to secure text through various encryption algorithms. It features a robust encryption/decryption engine supporting Caesar, XOR, and Vigenere ciphers, providing both practical utility and an educational component that explains the history and logic behind each method. Beyond simple text processing, the application includes a full Notes System capable of creating, editing, deleting, and storing entries in a persistent local file (data.txt). This allows users to not only write and organize personal notes but also selectively encrypt their contents for added privacy, making it a comprehensive tool for learning basic cryptographic principles while managing sensitive information. | C; Standard Libraries |
